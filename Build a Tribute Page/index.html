            <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
            <hr>
            <p id="tribute-info">
                Borlaug was often called <b>"the father of the Green Revolution"</b>,and is credited
                with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation. According to Jan Douglas,
                executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation,
                the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 article <b>"Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity."</b>
                The article states that the "form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion
                deaths."
                He was awarded the <u>Nobel Peace Prize</u> in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace
                through
                increasing food supply.
